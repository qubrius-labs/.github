# Qubrius â€“ Mission  

> **Secure today, quantumâ€‘proof for tomorrow.**

Qubrius exists to help the *midâ€‘market*â€”federalâ€‘supplyâ€‘chain vendors, cloudâ€‘native SaaS shops, and criticalâ€‘infrastructure operatorsâ€”meet the postâ€‘quantum cryptography (PQC) deadlines **without** sixâ€‘figure consulting fees or proprietary lockâ€‘in.

### What we believe
* **Open code builds trust.**Â Anyone can inspect, fork, or extend our scanners and playbooks.  
* **Compliance should be turnkey.**Â Executives need a boardâ€‘ready PDF, not pages of raw JSON.  
* **Vendorâ€‘neutral beats hardware handcuffs.**Â All our tools work on commodity CPUs and any cloud.  
* **Bilingual matters.**Â We serve Northâ€‘ and Latinâ€‘American teams, so docs ship in *EnglishÂ +Â EspaÃ±ol*.  
* **Continuous > oneâ€‘off.**Â PQC is a journeyâ€”our managed keyâ€‘rotation and algorithm watch keep you compliant long after the first migration.
